#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Formative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| See the displayed objectives, apparatus and reagents used then click on next button | Display objective, apparatus and solutions used | Recall the experiment
2.| Click on the funnel to keep it on top of the burette then add silver nitrate solution, click on next button | Display fill the burette with the silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) solution up to zero mark | To provide basic environment to start the experiment
3.| Click on the pipette to take 10ml of sodium chloride (NaCl) solution from the beaker, and add it to conical flask, click on next button | Display add 10ml of 0.0141N standard sodium chloride (NaCl) solution to a conical flask via graduated pipette carefully without forming air bubbles | To add 10ml of 0.0141N standard sodium chloride (NaCl) solution to a conical flask
4.| Click on dropper to take potassium chromate solution in it and then add it to the conical flask, click on next button | Display add 10 drops of potassium chromate as indicator to the conical flask | To add potassium chromate solution to the conical flask
5.| Click on the knob of the burette and titrate it until the solution turns to reddish pink, click on next button | Display titrate the Sodium Chloride solution until the colour change from yellow to reddish pink | To obtain the burette readings
